# About Repo TransferLearning
This repo is mainly to show Transfer Learning. We can take a model that someone else has trained and get our model quickly by freezing or modifying some of the layers. It's just a very simple demo, but we can use this example to extend to other complex models, such as VGG16, ResNet, etc.
## Run
```bash
python3 transferLearning.py
```
